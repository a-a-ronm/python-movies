# Analyzing movie ratings in pandas

Comparing and contrasting top rated movies using IMDb ratings and critic and audience scores on Rotten Tomatoes. Some basic analysis and visualization is performed using pandas. To retrieve data, API requests and JSON parsing are used as well.

IMDb data is taken from IMDb's [Top 250 Movies list](https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/?ref_=nv_mv_250) via the third-party [IMDb API](https://imdb-api.com/). Rotten Tomatoes data is from [Stefano Leone on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/rotten-tomatoes-movies-and-critic-reviews-dataset).
